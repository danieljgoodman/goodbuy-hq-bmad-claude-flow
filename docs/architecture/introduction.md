# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for GoodBuy HQ, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Status:** Greenfield project with modern fullstack technology choices

Based on the PRD analysis, GoodBuy HQ is a new AI-powered business valuation platform requiring:
- Traditional server architecture for consistent AI processing performance
- Monorepo structure for rapid development with Claude Code
- Modern fullstack framework supporting both frontend and backend requirements
- Integration with AI services, payment processing, and document intelligence

No existing templates or starter projects were specified, allowing for optimal technology selection based on requirements.
