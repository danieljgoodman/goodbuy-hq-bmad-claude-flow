# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- CSP Headers: Strict content security policy with allowed sources for Claude API, Supabase, and Stripe
- XSS Prevention: Input sanitization with DOMPurify, CSP enforcement, React's built-in protection
- Secure Storage: JWT tokens in httpOnly cookies, encrypted localStorage, automatic token rotation

**Backend Security:**
- Input Validation: Zod schema validation on all endpoints, SQL injection prevention through RLS
- Rate Limiting: Tiered rate limiting based on user type and endpoint sensitivity
- CORS Policy: Restricted origins with credentials support

**Authentication Security:**
- Token Storage: Secure httpOnly cookies with SameSite=strict
- Session Management: Supabase Auth with refresh tokens, concurrent session limits
- Password Policy: Strong password requirements with complexity validation

## Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle Size Target: <500KB initial bundle, <2MB total assets
- Loading Strategy: Lazy loading, image optimization, progressive enhancement
- Caching Strategy: Browser caching, SWR for data, service worker for offline

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: <200ms for queries, <3s for AI processing, <500ms for auth
- Database Optimization: Indexed queries, connection pooling, query optimization
- Caching Strategy: Redis for AI responses, database query caching, CDN for static content
