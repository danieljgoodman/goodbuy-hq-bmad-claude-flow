# Project Brief: Dashboard Tier Expansion for Professional & Enterprise Subscriptions

*Business Analyst Planning Document - September 16, 2025*

## Executive Summary

**Dashboard Tier Expansion Project for GoodBuy HQ**

This project plans the dashboard architecture expansion to support Professional and Enterprise subscription tiers, building upon the existing Basic tier dashboard. The solution implements subscription-based dashboard routing to display tier-appropriate data visualizations without exposing empty charts to lower-tier users.

**Key Requirements:**
- Professional tier: Enhanced visualizations for 30 additional business metrics
- Enterprise tier: Advanced scenario modeling dashboards for 55+ strategic data points
- Subscription-based routing to tier-specific dashboard views
- Seamless integration with existing Basic tier infrastructure

**Primary Challenge:** Extending current dashboard system to handle significantly more complex data while maintaining clean user experience across subscription levels.

## Problem Statement

**Current State & Pain Points:**

Our existing Basic tier dashboard successfully displays fundamental business metrics (~15 data points) with health scores and basic opportunities. However, we're launching Professional and Enterprise tiers that capture 45-80 additional sophisticated business data points including:

- 3-year financial trend analysis
- Customer concentration risk metrics
- Competitive positioning data
- Strategic scenario modeling (Enterprise only)
- Investment ROI projections

**The Problem:**
Without tier-specific dashboards, we face a critical UX dilemma:
1. **Show all advanced charts to Basic users** → Empty/sparse visualizations create poor user experience
2. **Hide advanced features entirely** → Professional/Enterprise users don't see the value they're paying for
3. **Single dashboard with conditional rendering** → Complex, cluttered interface that serves no tier well

**Impact & Urgency:**
- **Revenue Impact**: Cannot launch Professional ($99-199) and Enterprise ($300-500) tiers without compelling dashboard experiences
- **Competitive Disadvantage**: Advanced users expect sophisticated analytics matching their data depth
- **User Retention Risk**: Paying customers seeing Basic-level visualizations will churn

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**
- Current dashboard assumes uniform data availability across all users
- No subscription-awareness in component rendering logic
- Missing visualization components for advanced metrics (trend analysis, scenario modeling, ROI projections)

## Proposed Solution

**Core Solution Approach:**

**Subscription-Aware Dashboard Routing Architecture**

Implement a three-tier dashboard system with intelligent routing based on user subscription level:

1. **Basic Dashboard** (Current) - Remains unchanged, ~15 core metrics
2. **Professional Dashboard** - Enhanced analytics for 45+ data points with actionable ROI insights
3. **Enterprise Dashboard** - Advanced scenario modeling and strategic planning tools for 80+ data points

**Key Technical Approach:**
- **Route-level separation** (`/dashboard/basic`, `/dashboard/professional`, `/dashboard/enterprise`)
- **Shared component library** with tier-specific orchestration
- **Progressive data loading** based on subscription permissions
- **Conditional navigation** showing only accessible dashboard sections

**Core Differentiators:**

**Professional Tier Dashboard Features:**
- Multi-year trend visualization (3-year revenue/profit/cash flow)
- Customer concentration risk heat maps
- Competitive positioning spider charts
- Investment ROI scenario calculators
- Operational capacity utilization meters

**Enterprise Tier Dashboard Features:**
- All Professional features PLUS:
- Strategic scenario comparison matrices (5-year projections)
- Exit strategy modeling dashboards
- Capital structure optimization tools
- Multi-scenario financial projections
- Strategic option valuation displays

**Why This Solution Succeeds:**

1. **Clean User Experience**: Each tier sees only relevant, data-rich visualizations
2. **Scalable Architecture**: Component reuse with tier-specific orchestration
3. **Revenue Optimization**: Clear value demonstration justifies subscription upgrades
4. **Development Efficiency**: Builds on existing dashboard infrastructure
