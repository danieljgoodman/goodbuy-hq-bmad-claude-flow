# Story 1.3: Business Information Collection Interface

## Status
Draft

## Story

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.2 provides authenticated user context and profile data needed for associating business information with users.

### Data Models
**BusinessEvaluation Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#businessevaluation]:
```typescript
interface BusinessEvaluation {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  businessData: {
    annualRevenue: number;
    monthlyRecurring: number;
    expenses: number;
    cashFlow: number;
    assets: number;
    liabilities: number;
    customerCount: number;
    marketPosition: string;
  };
  valuations: {
    assetBased: number;
    incomeBased: number;
    marketBased: number;
    weighted: number;
    methodology: string;
  };
  healthScore: number;
  confidenceScore: number;
  topOpportunities: ImprovementOpportunity[];
  status: 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

**User Relationship** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user-relationships]:
- User has one-to-many relationship with BusinessEvaluations

### API Specifications
**Business Evaluation Endpoints** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#service-architecture]:
- Traditional Next.js API routes organized by feature domains (evaluations)
- Repository pattern implementation for data access
- `/api/business-evaluations` - POST/GET/PUT operations for business data

### Component Specifications
**Evaluation Components** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]:
```
src/components/evaluation/
├── evaluation-form.tsx      # Multi-step business information form
├── valuation-results.tsx    # Results display component
├── health-score.tsx         # Health score visualization  
└── opportunities-list.tsx   # Improvement opportunities list
```

**UI Components Required** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]:
```
src/components/ui/
├── form.tsx                 # Base form components
├── data-table.tsx          # Data display tables
└── card.tsx                # Card containers for form sections
```

### File Locations

    └── evaluation.ts
```

### Technical Constraints
**Form and Validation Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]:
- Input Validation: Use Zod schemas for all API input validation
- State Updates: Never mutate state directly - use proper state management patterns
- Database Access: Use repository pattern, never direct Supabase calls in API routes
- Error Handling: All API routes must use the standard error handler

**Component Naming** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions]:
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `EvaluationForm.tsx`)
- API Routes: kebab-case (e.g., `/api/business-evaluations`)

### State Management
**Evaluation State Management** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]:
- Zustand for lightweight, TypeScript-native state management
- Separate stores for evaluations and progress tracking
- Form state persistence for multi-step completion

### Testing Requirements
**Form Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]:
- Unit Tests: Vitest + React Testing Library for form components
- Integration Tests: Vitest + Supertest for evaluation API testing
- E2E Tests: Playwright for complete onboarding flow testing

## Testing
**Test Organization** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]:
- Test files located in `tests/` directory within apps/web/
- Testing frameworks: Vitest for unit/integration, Playwright for E2E
- Target: 90%+ coverage for critical business logic

**Testing Standards for this Story**:
- Test multi-step form navigation and validation
- Test auto-save functionality and data persistence
- Test form validation with various input scenarios
- Test data quality checks and business rules
- Test recovery functionality for partial form completion
