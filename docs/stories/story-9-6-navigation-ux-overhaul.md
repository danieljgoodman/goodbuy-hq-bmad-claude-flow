# Story 9.6: Navigation & User Experience Overhaul - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **new user of the platform**,
I want **intuitive navigation and clear user flow guidance throughout all platform features**,
So that **I can easily discover capabilities, complete evaluations efficiently, and maximize the platform's value without confusion**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Current Next.js routing, existing page layouts, user onboarding flow
- Technology: Next.js App Router, ShadCN/ui navigation components, existing layout structure
- Follows pattern: Current navigation patterns extended with enhanced UX principles
- Touch points: Main navigation, page layouts, user flows, mobile responsiveness

## Acceptance Criteria

**Navigation Structure Enhancement:**

1. Redesign main navigation with clear information architecture and logical feature grouping
2. Implement contextual navigation that adapts based on user subscription tier and completion status
3. Add breadcrumb navigation for complex multi-step processes (evaluations, implementation guides)
4. Create persistent navigation helper for new users with progressive disclosure
5. Implement mobile-first navigation design with touch-friendly interactions

**User Flow Optimization:**

6. Add comprehensive onboarding flow with interactive tour of key features and value propositions
7. Implement progress indicators throughout multi-step processes (registration, evaluation, improvement tracking)
8. Create contextual help system with tooltips, guided tours, and just-in-time assistance
9. Add empty states with clear next actions for new users and sections without data
10. Implement smart shortcuts and quick actions for experienced users

**User Experience Improvements:**

11. Design responsive dashboard with customizable widgets and priority information display
12. Add search functionality across evaluations, improvement opportunities, and help content
13. Implement notification system for important updates, reminders, and achievement milestones
14. Create consistent loading states and error handling with helpful recovery actions
15. Add accessibility improvements meeting WCAG AA standards throughout platform

**Integration Requirements:**

16. Enhanced navigation integrates seamlessly with existing authentication and routing
17. New UX patterns follow established ShadCN/ui design system and component library
18. User flow improvements maintain current performance while adding enhanced functionality

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Systematic redesign of navigation components and user flows while preserving existing functionality
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Build upon current ShadCN layout patterns and Next.js routing structure
- **Key Constraints:** Must maintain existing URLs and user data while significantly improving user experience

## Definition of Done

- [x] Complete navigation redesign implemented with improved information architecture
- [x] User onboarding and flow optimization tested with real users and feedback incorporated
- [x] Existing functionality remains accessible through new navigation structure
- [x] Code follows existing design system and component patterns
- [x] Tests pass for navigation functionality and user flow scenarios
- [x] Accessibility compliance verified and performance impact minimized

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Navigation changes confuse existing users and reduce platform efficiency
- **Mitigation:** A/B testing for navigation changes, user feedback collection, gradual rollout with fallback options
- **Rollback:** Feature flag to revert to previous navigation, preserve all new UX enhancements as optional

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [x] No breaking changes to existing page URLs or deep links
- [x] Database changes minimal (user preference storage only)
- [x] UI changes enhance existing design system without disruption
- [x] Performance optimized for mobile and accessibility requirements

## Implementation Details

  requiresCompletion?: string; // prerequisite step
}

const mainNavigation: NavigationItem[] = [
  {
    label: 'Dashboard',
    href: '/dashboard',
    icon: HomeIcon,
    badge: 'NEW'
  },
  {
    label: 'Evaluations',
