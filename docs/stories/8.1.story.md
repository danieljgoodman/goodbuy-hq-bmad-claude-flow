# Story 8.1: Smart Data Input Foundation

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** business owner evaluating my company,  
**I want** to choose between manual input and document upload during onboarding,  
**so that** I can provide business information in the most convenient way for my situation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Onboarding flow presents choice between "Manual Input" and "Upload Documents" with clear explanations
2. Document upload supports PDF, Excel, and common business document formats up to 50MB
3. Upload interface shows progress indicators and provides clear error handling for unsupported formats
4. Manual input option maintains exact existing functionality and user experience
5. Choice preference is saved and can be changed in user settings

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create choice selection component for onboarding (AC: 1)
  - [x] Design choice screen UI with clear explanations
  - [x] Add routing logic to redirect to chosen method
  - [x] Implement choice persistence in user preferences
- [x] Implement document upload infrastructure (AC: 2, 3)
  - [x] Create document upload component with file validation
  - [x] Add progress indicators and error handling
  - [x] Integrate with Supabase Storage for file storage
  - [x] Implement file type and size validation (50MB limit)
- [x] Ensure manual input path remains unchanged (AC: 4)
  - [x] Verify existing manual flow works identically
  - [x] Add regression tests for manual input
- [x] Add user settings integration (AC: 5)
  - [x] Store input method preference in user profile
  - [x] Add setting to change preference in user settings
- [x] Testing and validation
  - [x] Unit tests for upload components
  - [x] Integration tests for choice persistence
  - [x] E2E tests for both onboarding paths

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in Epic 8, building foundation for AI document processing capabilities.

### Data Models
**User Preferences Extension** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user-preferences]
```typescript
interface UserPreferences {
  inputMethod: 'manual' | 'document_upload';
  // existing fields...
}
```

**File Upload Schema** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#file-storage]
- Files stored in Supabase Storage with metadata in `uploaded_documents` table
- Support for PDF, Excel (.xlsx, .xls), and common business document formats
- 50MB file size limit as per Vercel function constraints

### API Specifications
**File Upload Endpoints** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#file-upload]
- `POST /api/v2/documents/upload` - Handle file uploads with validation
- `GET /api/v2/user/preferences` - Retrieve user input method preference
- `PUT /api/v2/user/preferences` - Update user input method preference

### Component Specifications
**Document Upload Component** [Source: architecture/components.md#document-components]
- Location: `src/components/documents/document-upload.tsx`
- Props: `onUploadComplete`, `acceptedTypes`, `maxSize`
- Integrates with existing ShadCN/ui components (Button, Progress, Alert)

**Choice Selection Component** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]
- Location: `src/components/onboarding/input-method-choice.tsx`
- Uses existing auth flow patterns and protected route structure

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- Components: `apps/web/src/components/documents/` and `apps/web/src/components/onboarding/`
- API Routes: `apps/web/src/app/api/v2/documents/` and `apps/web/src/app/api/v2/user/`
- Types: `apps/web/src/types/documents.ts` and extend `apps/web/src/types/user.ts`

### Technical Constraints
- Next.js 14+ App Router architecture [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- TypeScript 5.3+ for type safety
- Supabase Storage integration for file handling
- File uploads must work within Vercel function timeout limits
- Maintain existing ShadCN/ui component patterns

### Testing

#### Testing Standards
**Test File Locations** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#file-structure]
- Component tests: `apps/web/tests/components/documents/` and `apps/web/tests/components/onboarding/`
- API tests: `apps/web/tests/api/v2/documents/` and `apps/web/tests/api/v2/user/`

**Testing Frameworks** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#framework]
- Vitest + React Testing Library for component testing
- Playwright for E2E testing of onboarding flows
- API testing using Vitest for backend endpoints

**Specific Testing Requirements**
- File upload error handling (invalid types, oversized files)
- User preference persistence across sessions
- Regression testing for existing manual input flow
- Cross-browser compatibility for file upload functionality
