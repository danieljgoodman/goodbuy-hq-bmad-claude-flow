## Technical Implementation

**Onboarding System Architecture:**

```typescript
interface OnboardingStep {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  component: React.ComponentType<OnboardingStepProps>;
  completionCriteria: string[];
  skipAllowed: boolean;
  estimatedTime: string;
}

interface OnboardingState {
  currentStep: number;
  completedSteps: string[];
  isActive: boolean;
  isSkipped: boolean;
  lastActiveDate: Date;
}

interface UserOnboardingProgress {
  userId: string;
  onboardingVersion: string;
  currentStep: number;
  completedSteps: string[];
  skippedSteps: string[];
  startedAt: Date;
  completedAt?: Date;
  totalTimeSpent: number;
}
```

**Onboarding Flow Configuration:**

```typescript
const onboardingFlow: OnboardingStep[] = [
  {
    id: 'welcome',
    title: 'Welcome to Business Valuation AI',
    description: 'Discover how to get accurate business valuations',
    component: WelcomeStep,
    completionCriteria: ['watched_overview', 'viewed_examples'],
    skipAllowed: false,
    estimatedTime: '2-3 minutes'
  },
  {
    id: 'dashboard_tour',
    title: 'Your Dashboard Tour',
    description: 'Learn to navigate your business insights',
    component: DashboardTourStep,
    completionCriteria: ['toured_dashboard', 'understood_navigation'],
    skipAllowed: true,
    estimatedTime: '2 minutes'
  },
  {
    id: 'first_evaluation',
    title: 'Create Your First Evaluation',
    description: 'Get your business valuation with guided assistance',
    component: FirstEvaluationStep,
    completionCriteria: ['started_evaluation', 'completed_questionnaire'],
    skipAllowed: true,
    estimatedTime: '10-15 minutes'
  },
  {
    id: 'next_steps',
    title: 'Maximize Your Business Value',
    description: 'Explore improvement opportunities and tracking',
    component: NextStepsStep,
    completionCriteria: ['viewed_improvements', 'understood_premium'],
    skipAllowed: true,
    estimatedTime: '3-4 minutes'
  }
];
```

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Onboarding Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Onboarding flow overwhelms new users and reduces platform engagement
- **Mitigation:** A/B testing with different onboarding lengths, clear skip options, progress saving
- **Rollback:** Feature flag to disable onboarding, direct users to dashboard

**User Experience Compatibility:**

- [x] Onboarding integrates smoothly with existing registration and dashboard flows
- [x] No interference with existing user workflows for returning users
- [x] Mobile and desktop onboarding experiences equally effective
- [x] Onboarding data collection respects privacy preferences and GDPR compliance

## Implementation Details

**Onboarding Trigger Logic:**

```typescript
const useOnboardingTrigger = () => {
  const { user, isNewUser } = useAuth();
  const { onboardingState } = useOnboarding();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isNewUser && !onboardingState.isCompleted) {
      // Trigger onboarding after successful registration
      triggerOnboarding();
    }
  }, [isNewUser, onboardingState]);
};
```

**Progress Persistence:**

```typescript
const persistOnboardingProgress = async (userId: string, progress: OnboardingState) => {
  await updateUserPreferences(userId, {
    onboarding: {
      ...progress,
      lastUpdated: new Date()
    }
  });
};
```

**Analytics Integration:**

```typescript
const trackOnboardingEvent = (event: OnboardingEvent) => {
  analytics.track('Onboarding Event', {
    step: event.stepId,
    action: event.action,
    timeSpent: event.duration,
    userId: event.userId,
    onboardingVersion: ONBOARDING_VERSION
  });
};
```

**Step Completion Criteria:**

- **Welcome Step**: User watches overview video and views success examples
- **Dashboard Tour**: User completes guided tour of main dashboard sections
- **First Evaluation**: User initiates evaluation creation (completion optional)
- **Next Steps**: User views improvement opportunities or premium features

## Success Metrics

**Onboarding Effectiveness:**
- **Completion Rate**: 70%+ users complete full onboarding flow
- **First Evaluation Rate**: 85%+ users who complete onboarding create first evaluation
- **Time to First Value**: Average 15 minutes from registration to first evaluation result
- **User Retention**: 40%+ improvement in 7-day retention for onboarded users

## Estimated Effort: 8-10 hours focused development
