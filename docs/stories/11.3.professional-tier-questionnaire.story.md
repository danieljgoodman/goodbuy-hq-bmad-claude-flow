# Story 11.3: Professional Tier Questionnaire Implementation

**Epic:** Professional & Enterprise Tier Expansion
**Status:** Approved
**Assignee:** TBD
**Created:** September 17, 2025
**Story Points:** 8

## Story Statement

As a **Professional tier subscriber**,
I want **to complete a comprehensive 45-field questionnaire with professional explanations**,
So that **I can provide the detailed business data needed for enhanced valuation analysis and actionable insights**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Current questionnaire flow in evaluation creation process
- Technology: Next.js 15.5.3 + React + shadcn/ui components + Zod validation
- Follows pattern: Existing multi-step questionnaire form with progress tracking
- Touch points: User onboarding, evaluation creation, subscription tier routing

**Enhancement Details:**
This story implements the Professional tier questionnaire with 30 additional fields (beyond Basic's 15) organized into 5 sections: Financial Performance, Customer & Risk Analysis, Competitive & Market Analysis, Operational & Strategic Planning, and Value Enhancement. Each field includes professional "Why we need this" explanations to build user trust and understanding.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Professional tier questionnaire displays all 30 additional fields** organized in 5 logical sections
2. **Each field includes professional methodology explanation** ("Why we need this") as defined in tier-expansion-strategy.md
3. **Form validation enforces Professional tier field requirements** with appropriate error messages
4. **Progress tracking shows completion across all Professional sections** with clear visual indicators

### User Experience Requirements:
5. **Professional language maintains business credibility** while remaining accessible to business owners
6. **Conditional field logic shows/hides relevant questions** based on previous responses
7. **Form saves progress automatically** allowing users to complete over multiple sessions
8. **Clear visual distinction** between Basic and Professional tier sections

### Integration Requirements:
9. **Questionnaire only accessible to Professional tier subscribers** with upgrade prompts for Basic users
10. **Form data integrates with Professional tier database schema** from story 11.1
11. **Existing Basic tier questionnaire functionality remains unchanged** for backward compatibility

### Quality Requirements:
12. **Form performance remains optimal** despite 3x increase in field complexity
13. **Mobile responsive design** maintains usability across all device sizes
14. **Accessibility compliance** (WCAG 2.1 AA) for all new form components

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** Complex 45-field form overwhelming users and causing abandonment
**Mitigation:** Progressive disclosure, clear section organization, auto-save, methodology explanations
**Rollback Plan:** Feature flag to disable Professional questionnaire, fallback to Basic tier for all users

**Secondary Risk:** Form performance degradation with increased complexity
**Mitigation:** Code splitting, lazy loading, performance monitoring, progressive enhancement
**Rollback Plan:** Simplified form version with reduced field complexity

## Dependencies

- Story 11.1: Professional tier database schema (for data storage)
- Stripe subscription tier verification system
