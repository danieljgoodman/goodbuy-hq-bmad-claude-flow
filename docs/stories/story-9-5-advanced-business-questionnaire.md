# Story 9.5: Advanced Business Questionnaire - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **business owner seeking accurate business valuation**,
I want **an enhanced business questionnaire with improved data collection and user experience**,
So that **I can provide comprehensive business information efficiently and receive more accurate valuations**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Current business evaluation form, BusinessEvaluation model, AI valuation engine
- Technology: Next.js forms with Zod validation, Claude AI integration, PostgreSQL data storage
- Follows pattern: Existing evaluation form structure and AI processing workflow
- Touch points: Business data collection, AI valuation processing, document upload auto-fill
- **CRITICAL**: Preserves existing Step 2 document upload with auto-fill functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

**Enhanced Questionnaire Structure (23 Elements):**

1. **Business Basics**: Business name, website, industry/sector, year founded, location
2. **Owner Involvement**: Weekly hours, business dependency level (yes/no/partial)
3. **Evaluation Purpose**: Reason for seeking evaluation (retirement, sale, curiosity, investment, other)
4. **Financial Core**: Annual revenue (3 years), current profitability status
5. **Optional Advanced**: EBITDA (3 years) as optional field with helpful tooltips
6. **Asset Structure**: Real estate ownership (own/lease), conditional market value estimation
7. **Physical Assets**: FF&E and inventory values (industry-dependent conditional display)
8. **Team Structure**: Employee counts (full-time/part-time), management team existence
9. **Market Position**: Customer concentration risk (single client >20% revenue), competitive advantages
10. **Growth & Competition**: Growth opportunities, key competitors (conditional), online presence rating (conditional)

**User Experience Enhancements:**

11. **"Why we ask this" tooltips** for all complex fields explaining valuation relevance
12. **Progressive disclosure** - advanced financial fields shown conditionally
13. **Logical sectioning** - 3 clear sections: Business Overview → Financial Health → Operations & Market
14. **Save/resume capability** for longer completion sessions
15. **Industry-specific logic** - show inventory fields only for relevant industries

**System Integration:**

16. **Preserve existing document upload** with auto-fill functionality from Step 2
17. **Maintain current evaluation engine** - no changes to valuation algorithms
18. **Account integration** - leverage existing user data (name, email, phone from registration)
19. **Data consent** - single data processing agreement checkbox

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Update existing questionnaire form while preserving all backend functionality
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Maintain current multi-step evaluation flow (document upload + questionnaire + results)
- **Key Constraints:** Enhance user experience without breaking existing document auto-fill or evaluation processing
- **Database Impact:** Minimal - update form fields, preserve existing data structures and processing

## Definition of Done

- **Primary Risk:** Complex financial questionnaire overwhelms users and reduces completion rates
- **Mitigation:** Progressive disclosure, smart defaults, extensive help text, and optional advanced sections
- **Rollback:** Feature flag to revert to simplified questionnaire, preserve enhanced data for users who provided it
