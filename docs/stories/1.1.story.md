## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories - this is the foundation story.

### Data Models
**User Model Required** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user]:
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  businessName: string;
  industry: string;
  role: 'owner' | 'manager' | 'advisor';
  subscriptionTier: 'free' | 'premium' | 'enterprise';
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  lastLoginAt: Date;
}
```

**Database Schema Setup Required** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]:
- Enable UUID extension for primary keys
- Create users table with RLS policies
- Set up proper indexes for performance
- Configure Row Level Security policies for data privacy

### API Specifications
**Next.js API Routes Structure** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#service-architecture]:
- Traditional Next.js API routes with persistent server processes
- Organized by feature domains (auth, evaluations, documents, subscriptions, progress)
- Repository pattern implementation with BaseRepository class

### Component Specifications
**Frontend Component Organization** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]:
```
src/components/
├── ui/                     # ShadCN/ui base components
├── layout/                 # Layout components  
├── auth/                   # Authentication components
├── evaluation/             # Business evaluation components
├── documents/              # Document intelligence components
├── premium/                # Premium feature components
├── dashboard/              # Dashboard components
└── charts/                 # Data visualization components
```

**State Management** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]:
- Zustand for lightweight, TypeScript-native state management
- Separate stores for auth, subscriptions, evaluations, and progress tracking

### File Locations
**Unified Project Structure** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:

```

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+, TypeScript 5.3+, ShadCN/ui, Tailwind CSS 3.4+
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes 14+, TypeScript 5.3+
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+, Supabase Auth, Prisma ORM
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library, Playwright for E2E
- **Build**: Turbopack, Next.js native bundling
- **Deployment**: Vercel CLI, GitHub Actions

### Technical Constraints
**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]:
- Type Sharing: Define types in packages/shared and import from there
- Environment Variables: Access only through config objects, never process.env directly
- Error Handling: All API routes must use the standard error handler
- Database Access: Use repository pattern, never direct Supabase calls in API routes
- Input Validation: Use Zod schemas for all API input validation

**Naming Conventions** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions]:
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `EvaluationForm.tsx`)
- Hooks: camelCase with 'use' (e.g., `useAuthStore.ts`)
- API Routes: kebab-case (e.g., `/api/business-evaluations`)
- Database Tables: snake_case (e.g., `business_evaluations`)

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]:
- Unit Tests: Vitest + React Testing Library for frontend, Vitest + Node for backend
- Integration Tests: Vitest + Supertest for API testing
- E2E Tests: Playwright for cross-browser testing
- Target: 90%+ coverage for critical business logic

## Testing
**Test Organization** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]:
- Comprehensive test structure covering components, API routes, services, and end-to-end user journeys
- Test files located in `tests/` directory within apps/web/
- Testing frameworks: Vitest for unit/integration, Playwright for E2E

**Testing Standards for this Story**:
- Test project initialization and configuration
- Verify database connectivity and schema setup
- Test component library integration and theming
- Validate development tooling setup (ESLint, Prettier, pre-commit hooks)
- Test CI/CD pipeline configuration
