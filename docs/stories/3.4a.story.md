- Business evaluation data structure and historical tracking

**Stories 3.1-3.3 Requirements**:
- Premium subscription validation for advanced analytics access
- Progress tracking data for trend analysis input
- Value impact calculations as data source for predictions

### Data Models
**Enhanced Analytics Model Required**:
```typescript
interface AdvancedAnalytics {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  analysisType: 'trend' | 'seasonal' | 'predictive' | 'cycle';
  timeRange: DateRange;
  metrics: AnalyticsMetric[];
  trends: TrendAnalysis[];
  predictions: ValuationForecast[];
  confidenceIntervals: ConfidenceInterval[];
  seasonalityData?: SeasonalPattern[];
  generatedAt: Date;
}

interface TrendAnalysis {
  metric: string;
  direction: 'increasing' | 'decreasing' | 'stable';
  strength: number; // 0-1 scale
  confidenceScore: number;
  statisticalSignificance: number;
  projectedChange: number;
}

interface ValuationForecast {
  date: Date;
  predictedValue: number;
  lowerBound: number;
  upperBound: number;
  confidenceLevel: number;
  modelAccuracy: number;
}
```

### API Specifications
**Enhanced Analytics Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/analytics/advanced-trends` - Get advanced trend analysis with confidence intervals
- `GET /api/analytics/predictions` - Get valuation forecasts and projections
- `GET /api/analytics/seasonality` - Get seasonal patterns for businesses with sufficient data
- `POST /api/analytics/forecast` - Generate custom forecast for specific timeframes
- `GET /api/analytics/model-performance` - Get prediction accuracy and model performance metrics

### Component Specifications

### Tech Stack Requirements
**Enhanced Analytics Stack** (building on current):
- **Statistics**: Simple-statistics or ml-js for statistical calculations
- **Forecasting**: Basic linear regression and moving averages (no heavy ML initially)
- **Visualization**: Enhanced Recharts/Chart.js with forecast overlays
- **Performance**: Caching for expensive calculations, background processing for predictions

### Technical Constraints
**Performance Requirements**:
- Cache advanced analytics calculations for 1 hour to reduce computation load
- Implement progressive loading for historical data analysis
- Use background processing for prediction calculations on large datasets
- Limit forecasting to 6-month projections to maintain accuracy

**Data Quality Requirements**:
- Require minimum 3 evaluations for basic trend analysis
- Require minimum 6 evaluations for seasonal analysis
- Implement data quality scoring to determine prediction reliability
- Provide confidence levels for all statistical calculations

### Testing Requirements
**Advanced Analytics Testing Strategy**:
- Test trend analysis with various data patterns (growth, decline, stable)
- Validate prediction accuracy with historical data cross-validation
- Test confidence interval calculations with statistical significance
- Verify seasonality detection with mock cyclical business data
- Performance test with large evaluation datasets (100+ evaluations)

## Testing
**Testing Standards for this Story**:
- Test enhanced analytics dashboard with real business evaluation data
- Validate statistical calculations and confidence intervals
- Test predictive modeling accuracy with historical validation
- Verify seasonality detection with businesses having sufficient data
- Test performance with premium subscription access control
