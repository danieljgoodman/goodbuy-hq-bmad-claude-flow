# Story 8.3: Dashboard Visualization Foundation

## Status
Completed

## Story

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 8.2 (AI Document Processing) may generate additional data that should be visualized in charts. Consider integration points for document-extracted metrics.

### Data Models
**Dashboard Metrics** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#evaluation-metrics]
```typescript
interface DashboardMetrics {
  businessValuation: number;
  healthScore: number;
  growthRate: number;
  riskLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  lastUpdated: Date;
}

interface ChartDataPoint {
  date: string;
  value: number;
  category: string;
}
```

**Activity Feed Data** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#activity-tracking]
```typescript
interface ActivityItem {
  id: string;
  type: 'evaluation_created' | 'data_updated' | 'document_processed';
  timestamp: Date;
  description: string;
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
}
```

### API Specifications
**Dashboard Data Endpoints** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#dashboard-api]
- `GET /api/v2/dashboard/metrics` - Retrieve KPI summary data
- `GET /api/v2/dashboard/charts?dateRange=...` - Get chart data with date filtering
- `GET /api/v2/dashboard/activity` - Fetch recent activity feed
- `GET /api/v2/evaluations/trends` - Historical trend data for charts

### Component Specifications
**Chart Components** [Source: architecture/components.md#chart-components]
- Location: `src/components/charts/`
- Base components: `valuation-chart.tsx`, `health-trend-chart.tsx`, `progress-chart.tsx`
- Use Recharts library for consistent React integration
- Props: `data`, `height`, `responsive`, `onInteraction`

**Dashboard Layout** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#dashboard-components]
- Location: `src/components/dashboard/dashboard-layout.tsx`
- Replaces existing basic grid layout
- Integrates with existing `metrics-overview.tsx` and `recent-evaluations.tsx`

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- Dashboard Components: `apps/web/src/components/dashboard/`
- Chart Components: `apps/web/src/components/charts/`
- Dashboard Pages: `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/`
- API Routes: `apps/web/src/app/api/v2/dashboard/`
- Types: `apps/web/src/types/dashboard.ts` and `apps/web/src/types/charts.ts`

### State Management
**Zustand Store Extensions** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management]
- Extend existing evaluation store for dashboard state
- Add chart data caching to reduce API calls
- Implement real-time updates for activity feed

### Technical Constraints
- Charts must load within 3 seconds [Source: architecture/performance-requirements.md]
- Mobile-first responsive design using Tailwind breakpoints [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Maintain existing ShadCN/ui component patterns and theming
- Chart interactions must be accessible (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- Memory usage must not exceed 20% increase from current dashboard

### Integration Points
**Existing Systems** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#business-evaluation]
- Business evaluation calculation engine (existing)
- Health score algorithms (existing)  
- User authentication and permissions (Supabase Auth)
- Real-time data updates (if implemented)

### Testing

#### Testing Standards
**Test File Locations** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#file-structure]
- Component tests: `apps/web/tests/components/dashboard/` and `apps/web/tests/components/charts/`
- Page tests: `apps/web/tests/app/(dashboard)/`
- API tests: `apps/web/tests/api/v2/dashboard/`

**Testing Frameworks** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#framework]
- Vitest + React Testing Library for component testing
- Playwright for E2E dashboard interactions
- Visual regression testing using Percy or similar for chart consistency

**Specific Testing Requirements**
- Chart rendering with various data sets (empty, single point, large datasets)
- Responsive behavior across all breakpoints
- Interactive elements (date range selection, chart hover states)
- Performance testing for chart rendering speed
- Accessibility testing for chart components (screen readers, keyboard navigation)
