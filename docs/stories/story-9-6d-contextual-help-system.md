# Story 9.6d: Contextual Help System Implementation - Brownfield Addition

## Status
Done

## User Story

As a **platform user encountering complex features or unfamiliar concepts**,
I want **contextual help and guidance available exactly when and where I need it**,
So that **I can understand how to use features effectively without leaving my current workflow**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: All platform features, existing ShadCN/ui tooltip components, user help documentation
- Technology: React context for help system, ShadCN/ui popover components, content management for help articles
- Follows pattern: Existing tooltip patterns enhanced with comprehensive contextual assistance
- Touch points: Complex forms, evaluation questionnaire, dashboard features, settings pages

## Acceptance Criteria

**Contextual Help Components:**

1. Implement "Why we ask this" tooltips for complex form fields across platform
2. Create interactive feature tours for multi-step processes (evaluations, account setup)
3. Add contextual help sidebar that appears with relevant articles based on current page
4. Implement smart help suggestions triggered by user behavior patterns
5. Create just-in-time assistance for error states and edge cases

**Help Content Management:**

6. Integrate searchable help article system with contextual triggering
7. Add video tutorial embedding for complex feature explanations
8. Implement help content versioning to match feature updates
9. Create feedback system for help content effectiveness measurement
10. Add help content analytics to identify gaps and optimization opportunities

**User Experience Integration:**

11. Help system integrates seamlessly without disrupting user workflow
12. Contextual help adapts based on user subscription tier and completed onboarding steps
13. Help suggestions learn from user interaction patterns and previous help requests
14. Multi-modal help delivery (tooltips, popovers, sidebar, modal overlays)

## Technical Implementation

**Help System Architecture:**

```typescript
interface HelpItem {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  type: 'tooltip' | 'popover' | 'article' | 'video' | 'tour';
  trigger: HelpTrigger;
  targeting: HelpTargeting;
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  version: string;
}

interface HelpTrigger {
  context: string[];           // Page paths or component contexts
  userActions?: string[];      // Specific user actions that trigger help
  userState?: HelpUserState;   // User conditions for help display
  timing?: HelpTiming;         // When to show help (immediate, delayed, etc.)
}

interface HelpTargeting {
  elementSelector?: string;    // DOM element to attach help to
  position: 'top' | 'bottom' | 'left' | 'right' | 'center';
  alignment?: 'start' | 'center' | 'end';
  offset?: { x: number; y: number };
}

interface HelpUserState {
  subscriptionTier?: 'free' | 'premium';
  onboardingCompleted?: boolean;
  experienceLevel?: 'new' | 'returning' | 'expert';
  lastHelpInteraction?: Date;
}
```

**Contextual Help Configuration:**

```typescript
const contextualHelpItems: HelpItem[] = [
  {
    id: 'ebitda-explanation',
    title: 'Understanding EBITDA',
    content: 'EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) helps us calculate your business\'s core profitability...',
    type: 'tooltip',
    trigger: {
      context: ['/evaluations/questionnaire'],
      userActions: ['focus:ebitda-field', 'hover:ebitda-label']
    },
    targeting: {
      elementSelector: '[data-field="ebitda"]',
      position: 'right',
      alignment: 'start'
    },
    priority: 'high',
    version: '1.0'
  },
  {
    id: 'evaluation-tour',
    title: 'Business Evaluation Walkthrough',
    content: 'Let us guide you through creating your first business evaluation...',
    type: 'tour',
    trigger: {
      context: ['/evaluations/new'],
      userState: {
        onboardingCompleted: false,
        experienceLevel: 'new'
      }
    },
    targeting: {
      position: 'center'
    },
    priority: 'medium',
    version: '1.0'
  },
  {
    id: 'premium-features-help',
    title: 'Unlock Advanced Features',
    content: 'Premium subscribers get access to implementation guides, progress tracking, and detailed improvement recommendations...',
    type: 'popover',
    trigger: {
      context: ['/dashboard', '/improvements'],
      userState: {
        subscriptionTier: 'free'
      },
      userActions: ['click:premium-feature']
    },
    targeting: {
      position: 'bottom',
      alignment: 'center'
    },
    priority: 'medium',
    version: '1.0'
  }
];
```

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Help System Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Contextual help becomes intrusive and disrupts user workflow
- **Mitigation:** User-controlled help preferences, non-blocking help delivery, smart timing algorithms
- **Rollback:** Feature flag to disable contextual help, maintain basic tooltip functionality

**Content Management Compatibility:**

- [x] Help content system integrates with existing documentation structure
- [x] Help triggers work across all platform pages without performance impact
- [x] Help system respects user preferences and accessibility requirements
- [x] Content versioning maintains help accuracy with feature updates

## Implementation Details

**Help Content Storage:**

```typescript
interface HelpContentStore {
  articles: Map<string, HelpArticle>;
  tooltips: Map<string, HelpTooltip>;
  tours: Map<string, HelpTour>;
  videos: Map<string, HelpVideo>;
}

const useHelpContent = (context: string, userState: HelpUserState) => {
  const [relevantHelp, setRelevantHelp] = useState<HelpItem[]>([]);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const contextualItems = filterHelpByContext(context, userState);
    setRelevantHelp(contextualItems);
  }, [context, userState]);
  
  return { relevantHelp, requestHelp, dismissHelp };
};
```

**Smart Help Triggering:**

```typescript
const useSmartHelpTriggers = () => {
  const trackUserBehavior = useCallback((action: UserAction) => {
    // Track user interactions and identify help opportunities
    const helpSuggestions = analyzeUserBehavior(action);
    if (helpSuggestions.length > 0) {
      triggerContextualHelp(helpSuggestions);
    }
  }, []);
  
  return { trackUserBehavior };
};
```

**Help Analytics Integration:**

```typescript
const trackHelpInteraction = (helpId: string, interaction: HelpInteraction) => {
  analytics.track('Help Interaction', {
    helpId,
    interactionType: interaction.type,
    helpful: interaction.helpful,
    context: interaction.context,
    userTier: interaction.userTier,
    timestamp: new Date()
  });
};
```

**Content Versioning:**

```typescript
interface HelpVersionManager {
  getCurrentVersion: (helpId: string) => string;
  updateContent: (helpId: string, newContent: HelpItem) => void;
  migrateUserPreferences: (oldVersion: string, newVersion: string) => void;
}
```
