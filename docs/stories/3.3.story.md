### Tech Stack Requirements
**Progress Tracking Stack**:
- **Analytics**: Chart.js/Recharts for progress visualization
- **File Upload**: AWS S3 or similar for evidence storage
- **AI Validation**: OpenAI Vision API for evidence validation
- **Calculations**: Custom ROI and valuation calculation engines

### Technical Constraints
**Progress Validation Requirements**:
- Implement AI-powered evidence validation for improvement claims
- Require photo/document evidence for significant value improvements
