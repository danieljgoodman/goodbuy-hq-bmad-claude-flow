# Story 11.2: Subscription-Based Routing Middleware

**Epic:** Professional & Enterprise Tier Expansion
**Status:** Ready for Review
**Assignee:** TBD
**Created:** September 17, 2025
**Story Points:** 5

## Story Statement

As a **GoodBuy HQ system**,
I want **to automatically route users to tier-appropriate features and dashboards based on their subscription level**,
So that **Basic users don't see empty advanced features and Professional/Enterprise users get immediate access to their paid capabilities**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Clerk authentication and Stripe subscription management
- Technology: Next.js 15.5.3 middleware + Clerk auth + Stripe webhooks
- Follows pattern: Existing middleware for auth and route protection
- Touch points: All protected routes, dashboard access, questionnaire flow, API endpoints

**Enhancement Details:**
This story implements intelligent subscription-aware routing that prevents the UX problem of Basic users seeing empty advanced charts while ensuring Professional/Enterprise users immediately access their tier-specific features. The middleware intercepts requests and routes users to appropriate interfaces based on their Stripe subscription tier.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements:
1. **Middleware automatically detects user subscription tier** from Stripe via Clerk metadata
2. **Basic tier users are routed to Basic dashboard** (`/dashboard/basic`) with no advanced features visible
3. **Professional tier users are routed to Professional dashboard** (`/dashboard/professional`) with enhanced analytics
4. **Enterprise tier users are routed to Enterprise dashboard** (`/dashboard/enterprise`) with full strategic features
5. **API endpoints enforce tier-based access** preventing lower-tier users from accessing higher-tier data

### User Experience Requirements:
6. **Routing is transparent to users** - no confusing redirects or tier exposure in URLs
7. **Upgrade prompts appear for insufficient tier access** with clear value proposition
8. **Navigation menus only show accessible features** based on user tier
9. **Graceful handling of subscription changes** with real-time tier updates

### Integration Requirements:
10. **Seamless integration with existing Clerk authentication** without breaking current auth flow
11. **Real-time subscription updates via Stripe webhooks** reflect immediately in routing
12. **Backward compatibility maintained** for existing Basic tier users with no changes to their experience

### Quality Requirements:
13. **Routing decisions complete in <100ms** to avoid user experience delays
14. **Fail-safe defaults to Basic tier** if subscription status unclear
15. **Comprehensive logging** for debugging tier routing issues

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights:
- Builds on authentication patterns already established in the codebase
- Critical foundation for all tier-specific features in subsequent stories
- Must be extremely reliable as it affects every user interaction

### Subscription Tier Architecture:
**Tier Detection Logic** [Source: docs/system-integration-planning-section-7.md#Subscription_Integration]:
```typescript
interface UserTierData {
  subscriptionTier: 'basic' | 'professional' | 'enterprise';
  stripeSubscriptionId?: string;
  stripeCustomerId: string;
  tierFeatures: string[];
  subscriptionStatus: 'active' | 'canceled' | 'past_due' | 'trialing';
  currentPeriodEnd: Date;
}

// Tier hierarchy for access control
const TIER_HIERARCHY = {
  basic: 0,
  professional: 1,
  enterprise: 2
} as const;

export const hasTierAccess = (
  userTier: keyof typeof TIER_HIERARCHY,
  requiredTier: keyof typeof TIER_HIERARCHY
): boolean => {
  return TIER_HIERARCHY[userTier] >= TIER_HIERARCHY[requiredTier];
};
```

**Routing Configuration** [Source: docs/dashboard-tier-expansion-planning.md#Technical_Approach]:
```typescript
// Route mapping based on subscription tier
const TIER_ROUTES = {
  basic: {
    dashboard: '/dashboard/basic',
    questionnaire: '/questionnaire/basic',
    reports: '/reports/basic'
  },
  professional: {
    dashboard: '/dashboard/professional',
    questionnaire: '/questionnaire/professional',
    reports: '/reports/professional'
  },
  enterprise: {
    dashboard: '/dashboard/enterprise',
    questionnaire: '/questionnaire/enterprise',
    reports: '/reports/enterprise'
  }
} as const;

// Protected routes requiring specific tiers
const PROTECTED_ROUTES = {
  '/dashboard/professional': 'professional',
  '/dashboard/enterprise': 'enterprise',
  '/questionnaire/professional': 'professional',
  '/questionnaire/enterprise': 'enterprise',
  '/api/evaluations/professional': 'professional',
  '/api/evaluations/enterprise': 'enterprise'
} as const;
```

### Middleware Implementation:
**Next.js Middleware** [Source: Existing middleware patterns]:
```typescript
// apps/web/middleware.ts
export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  // Existing auth check
  const { userId } = auth();
  if (!userId) {
    return redirectToSignIn();
  }

  // Get user subscription tier
  const userTier = await getUserSubscriptionTier(userId);

  // Check if route requires specific tier access
  const pathname = request.nextUrl.pathname;
  const requiredTier = getRequiredTierForRoute(pathname);

  if (requiredTier && !hasTierAccess(userTier, requiredTier)) {
    // Redirect to appropriate tier or show upgrade
    if (pathname.startsWith('/dashboard')) {
      return NextResponse.redirect(
        new URL(TIER_ROUTES[userTier].dashboard, request.url)
      );
    }

    // For API routes, return 403 with upgrade info
    if (pathname.startsWith('/api/')) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        {
          error: 'Insufficient tier access',
          requiredTier,
          currentTier: userTier,
          upgradeUrl: '/upgrade'
        },
        { status: 403 }
      );
    }
  }

  // Add tier info to headers for components
  const requestHeaders = new Headers(request.headers);
  requestHeaders.set('x-user-tier', userTier);

  return NextResponse.next({
    request: {
      headers: requestHeaders,
    },
  });
}

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    '/dashboard/:path*',
    '/questionnaire/:path*',
    '/reports/:path*',
    '/api/evaluations/:path*'
  ]
};
```

### Stripe Integration:
**Webhook Handling** [Source: docs/system-integration-planning-section-7.md#Stripe_Integration]:
```typescript
// Real-time subscription updates
export async function handleStripeWebhook(event: Stripe.Event) {
  switch (event.type) {
    case 'customer.subscription.updated':
    case 'customer.subscription.created':
      const subscription = event.data.object as Stripe.Subscription;
      const tierMapping = {
        'price_basic': 'basic',
        'price_professional': 'professional',
        'price_enterprise': 'enterprise'
      };

      const newTier = tierMapping[subscription.items.data[0].price.id];
      await updateUserTier(subscription.metadata.userId, newTier);

      // Invalidate session cache for immediate routing update
      await invalidateUserSession(subscription.metadata.userId);
      break;

    case 'customer.subscription.deleted':
      await updateUserTier(subscription.metadata.userId, 'basic');
      break;
  }
}
```

**Rollback Plan:** Feature flag to disable tier routing, immediate fallback to Basic tier access

**Secondary Risk:** Stripe webhook delays causing tier routing inconsistencies
**Mitigation:** Webhook retry logic, eventual consistency handling, manual tier override capability
**Rollback Plan:** Direct database tier updates, webhook replay functionality

## Dependencies

- Existing Clerk authentication system
- Stripe subscription management and webhook infrastructure
- Basic tier dashboard (existing)
- Professional and Enterprise tier route definitions (from subsequent stories)
