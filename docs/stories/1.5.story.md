### Data Models
**Dashboard Data Requirements** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#businessevaluation]:
```typescript
interface BusinessEvaluation {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  healthScore: number;           // Primary dashboard metric
  confidenceScore: number;       // Analysis confidence display
  topOpportunities: ImprovementOpportunity[]; // Key recommendations
  businessData: {               // Metrics for visualization
    annualRevenue: number;
    monthlyRecurring: number;
    expenses: number;
    cashFlow: number;
    assets: number;
    liabilities: number;
    customerCount: number;
    marketPosition: string;
  };
  valuations: {                 // Valuation data for charts
    assetBased: number;
    incomeBased: number;
    marketBased: number;
    weighted: number;
    methodology: string;
  };
  status: 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

**User Dashboard Context** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user]:
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  businessName: string;         // Dashboard personalization
  industry: string;             // Industry context display
  role: 'owner' | 'manager' | 'advisor';
  subscriptionTier: 'free' | 'premium' | 'enterprise'; // Feature gating
  lastLoginAt: Date;
}
```

### API Specifications

### Technical Constraints
**Dashboard Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]:
- State Management: Never mutate state directly - use proper state management patterns
- Premium Features: Gate premium content through subscription checks, not UI hiding
- Auth Context: Always check authentication through hooks for protected dashboard content
- Component Architecture: Use ShadCN/ui components for consistent design system

**Responsive Design Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Tailwind CSS 3.4+ for utility-first styling and responsive design
- ShadCN/ui component library for professional, accessible components
- Mobile-first responsive design approach

### State Management
**Dashboard State Architecture** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]:
- Zustand for lightweight, TypeScript-native state management
- Separate stores for dashboard data, evaluations, and user preferences
- Optimistic updates for improved user experience

### Routing Architecture
**Dashboard Navigation** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]:
- Next.js 14+ App Router with protected route groups
- Server-side authentication checks for dashboard access
- Nested routing for dashboard sections and features

### Testing Requirements
**Dashboard Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]:
- Unit Tests: Vitest + React Testing Library for dashboard components
- Integration Tests: Dashboard data fetching and state management
- E2E Tests: Playwright for complete dashboard user workflows

## Testing
**Test Organization** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]:
- Test files located in `tests/` directory within apps/web/
- Testing frameworks: Vitest for unit/integration, Playwright for E2E
- Target: 90%+ coverage for critical dashboard functionality

**Testing Standards for this Story**:
- Test dashboard layout and component rendering
- Test responsive design across different screen sizes
- Test data visualization accuracy and interactivity
- Test navigation structure and route protection
- Test mobile touch interactions and accessibility
