    weighted: number;
    methodology: string;
  };
  status: 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed';

### Technical Constraints
**Dashboard Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]:
- State Management: Never mutate state directly - use proper state management patterns
- Premium Features: Gate premium content through subscription checks, not UI hiding
- Auth Context: Always check authentication through hooks for protected dashboard content
- Component Architecture: Use ShadCN/ui components for consistent design system

**Responsive Design Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Tailwind CSS 3.4+ for utility-first styling and responsive design
- ShadCN/ui component library for professional, accessible components
- Mobile-first responsive design approach

### State Management
**Dashboard State Architecture** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]:
- Zustand for lightweight, TypeScript-native state management
- Separate stores for dashboard data, evaluations, and user preferences
- Optimistic updates for improved user experience

### Routing Architecture
**Dashboard Navigation** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#routing-architecture]:
- Next.js 14+ App Router with protected route groups
- Server-side authentication checks for dashboard access
- Nested routing for dashboard sections and features

### Testing Requirements
**Dashboard Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]:
- Unit Tests: Vitest + React Testing Library for dashboard components
- Integration Tests: Dashboard data fetching and state management
- E2E Tests: Playwright for complete dashboard user workflows

## Testing
**Test Organization** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]:
