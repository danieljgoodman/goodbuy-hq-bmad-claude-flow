# Story 9.4: Enhanced Sign-up Data Collection - Brownfield Addition

## Status
Done

## User Story

As a **business owner signing up for the platform**,
I want **a comprehensive yet user-friendly registration process that collects essential business information**,
So that **I receive more accurate AI valuations and the platform can provide better personalized recommendations**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Current Supabase Auth registration, User model, onboarding flow
- Technology: Next.js registration forms, Supabase Auth, TypeScript validation with Zod
- Follows pattern: Existing multi-step form patterns and ShadCN form components
- Touch points: User registration API, user profile creation, initial business data collection

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Implement progressive disclosure registration - essential info first, detailed business data in subsequent steps
2. Collect business address, owner contact information, and key business details during registration
3. Add industry-specific questions that enhance AI valuation accuracy
4. Include optional fields for business website, LinkedIn profile, and referral source
5. Implement smart form validation with real-time feedback and error handling
6. Add business registration completion tracking with ability to save progress and return later

**Data Collection Requirements:**

7. **Essential Information (Step 1):** Name, email, password, business name, industry sector
8. **Business Details (Step 2):** Business address, phone, years in operation, number of employees
9. **Financial Overview (Step 3):** Revenue range, business model, primary revenue sources
10. **Optional Information (Step 4):** Website, social profiles, how they heard about platform

**Integration Requirements:**

11. Enhanced registration integrates with existing Supabase Auth flow without breaking current users
12. New user data follows existing User model patterns with backward compatibility
13. Integration with onboarding flow maintains current user experience while adding value

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing registration forms with multi-step wizard, enhance User model with additional fields
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow current onboarding form structure and ShadCN form component patterns
- **Key Constraints:** Must maintain high conversion rates, GDPR compliance for personal data collection

## Definition of Done

- [x] Progressive registration flow implemented with optimal conversion tracking
- [x] All new user data fields properly validated and stored with privacy compliance
- [x] Existing registration functionality continues to work for current user types
- [x] Code follows existing form patterns and validation standards
- [x] Tests pass for new registration flow and existing auth integration
- [x] A/B testing framework ready for conversion optimization

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Extended registration process reduces sign-up conversion rates
- **Mitigation:** Progressive disclosure with early value delivery, optional vs required field optimization, A/B testing
- **Rollback:** Feature flag to revert to simple registration, preserve all collected data

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [x] No breaking changes to existing Supabase Auth integration
- [x] Database changes are additive only (new user profile fields)
- [x] UI follows existing registration page design patterns
- [x] Performance optimized for mobile and slow connections

## Implementation Details

**Database Schema Enhancements:**
```sql
-- Extend users table with business information
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN business_address JSONB;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN business_phone VARCHAR(20);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN years_in_operation INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN employee_count_range VARCHAR(50);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN revenue_range VARCHAR(50);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN business_model VARCHAR(100);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN website_url VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN linkedin_url VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN referral_source VARCHAR(100);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN registration_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN registration_step INTEGER DEFAULT 1;

-- Index for incomplete registrations
CREATE INDEX idx_users_registration_completed ON users(registration_completed);
```
