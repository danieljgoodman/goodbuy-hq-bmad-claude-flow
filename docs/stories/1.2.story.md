# Story 1.2: User Authentication System

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** business owner,
**I want** to create a secure account and log in to the platform,
**so that** I can save my business evaluation progress and access premium features when available.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User registration form with email validation and secure password requirements using Supabase Auth
2. Login/logout functionality with persistent session management and automatic token refresh
3. Password reset capability via email verification with secure token-based reset flow
4. User profile creation with basic business information fields (business name, industry, role)
5. Protected routes that redirect unauthenticated users to login page with proper state preservation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 establishes the foundational infrastructure including Supabase connection and User data model.

### Data Models
**User Model Implementation** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user]:
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  businessName: string;
  industry: string;
  role: 'owner' | 'manager' | 'advisor';
  subscriptionTier: 'free' | 'premium' | 'enterprise';
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  lastLoginAt: Date;
}
```

**User Relationships** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user-relationships]:
- One-to-many with BusinessEvaluations
- One-to-many with ImprovementProgress  
- One-to-one with Subscription

### API Specifications
**Supabase Authentication Endpoints** [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#supabase-services]:
- `POST /auth/v1/signup` - User registration and account creation
- `POST /auth/v1/token` - User authentication and session management
- Integration with Next.js middleware for authentication
- JWT tokens for user authentication with automatic refresh

**Authentication Integration Notes** [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#supabase-services]:
- Automatic connection pooling with Supabase
- Row Level Security for data privacy
- Integration with Next.js middleware for authentication

### Component Specifications
**Authentication Components** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]:
```
src/components/auth/
├── login-form.tsx          # Login form with validation
├── register-form.tsx       # Registration form with business info
└── protected-route.tsx     # Route protection wrapper
```

**State Management** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]:
- Zustand store for authentication state management
- Separate auth store for user session and profile data

### File Locations

```

### Technical Constraints
**Authentication Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]:
- Auth Context: Always check authentication through hooks, never access auth state directly
- Input Validation: Use Zod schemas for all API input validation
- Environment Variables: Access only through config objects, never process.env directly
- Error Handling: All API routes must use the standard error handler

**Backend Authentication Architecture** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#authentication-and-authorization]:
- JWT-based authentication with Supabase integration
- Comprehensive middleware for auth, rate limiting, and error handling

### Testing Requirements
**Authentication Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]:
- Unit Tests: Vitest + React Testing Library for authentication components
- Integration Tests: Vitest + Supertest for auth API testing
- E2E Tests: Playwright for complete authentication flows

## Testing
**Test Organization** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]:
- Test files located in `tests/` directory within apps/web/
- Testing frameworks: Vitest for unit/integration, Playwright for E2E
- Target: 90%+ coverage for critical authentication logic

**Testing Standards for this Story**:
- Test user registration flow with form validation
- Test login/logout functionality with session management
- Test password reset flow with email verification
- Test protected route access and redirect behavior
- Test user profile creation and editing functionality
