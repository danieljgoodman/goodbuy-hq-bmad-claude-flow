# Story 11.1: Professional Tier Database Schema Extension

**Epic:** Professional & Enterprise Tier Expansion
**Status:** Approved
**Assignee:** TBD
**Created:** September 17, 2025
**Story Points:** 5

## Story Statement

As a **Professional tier subscriber**,
I want **my detailed questionnaire responses to be properly stored and retrievable**,
So that **I can receive enhanced business analysis with 45+ data points and actionable insights**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Current Prisma schema and BusinessEvaluation model
- Technology: PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM 6.15.0 + Next.js 15.5.3
- Follows pattern: Existing BusinessData interface and evaluation storage
- Touch points: User subscription tiers, questionnaire forms, report generation

**Enhancement Details:**
This story extends the existing Basic tier (15 fields) database schema to support Professional tier questionnaires with 45+ fields across 6 categories: Financial Performance, Earnings Quality, Competitive Positioning, Operational Risk, Strategic Investment, and Value Enhancement.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements:
1. **Database schema supports all 30 new Professional tier fields** as defined in tier-expansion-strategy.md
2. **Existing Basic tier data and functionality remains unchanged** - zero breaking changes
3. **Professional tier data is properly typed and validated** using Zod schemas
4. **Data retrieval APIs support tier-specific field access** based on user subscription

### Integration Requirements:
5. **Existing BusinessEvaluation queries continue to work unchanged** - backward compatibility guaranteed
6. **New Professional tier fields follow existing naming and validation patterns**
7. **Integration with Clerk authentication and Stripe subscription status** for tier-based access

### Quality Requirements:
8. **Database migrations are reversible** with proper rollback procedures
9. **All new fields have appropriate database indexes** for performance
10. **Professional tier data validation prevents invalid submissions**

## Dev Notes

### Database Schema Extension:
**Prisma Schema Modifications** [Source: docs/system-integration-planning-section-7.md#Database_Schema_Extensions]:
```prisma
model BusinessEvaluation {
  // ... existing fields remain unchanged

  // Professional tier data (JSONB for flexibility)
  professionalTierData Json?

  // Tier metadata
  subscriptionTier String @default("basic") // 'basic' | 'professional' | 'enterprise'
  analysisDepth   String @default("basic") // tracks analysis complexity level

  // Indexes for performance
  @@index([subscriptionTier])
  @@index([userId, subscriptionTier])
  @@index([createdAt, subscriptionTier])
}

// Optional: Separate professional data table for better performance
model ProfessionalEvaluationData {
  id                    String            @id @default(cuid())
  businessEvaluationId  String            @unique
  businessEvaluation    BusinessEvaluation @relation(fields: [businessEvaluationId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  // All professional tier fields as typed columns
  revenue2024          Decimal?
  revenue2023          Decimal?
  revenue2022          Decimal?
  // ... all other professional fields

  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  @@index([businessEvaluationId])
}
```

### API Specifications:
**Tier-Aware Data Access** [Source: docs/system-integration-planning-section-7.md#Data_Access_Control]:
```typescript
// API endpoint modifications
GET /api/evaluations/[id]
- Response varies by user tier
- Professional users get professionalTierData
- Basic users get basic fields only

POST /api/evaluations
- Accepts tier-specific data based on user subscription
- Validates data against tier-appropriate schema

// New validation middleware
export const validateTierData = (requiredTier: string) => {
  return async (req: NextRequest) => {
    const { userId } = auth()
    const user = await getUserWithSubscription(userId)

    if (!hasTierAccess(user.subscriptionTier, requiredTier)) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Insufficient tier access' }, { status: 403 })
    }
  }
}
```

### File Locations:
- Database migration: `apps/web/prisma/migrations/001_add_professional_tier_schema.sql`
- Schema updates: `apps/web/prisma/schema.prisma`
- Type definitions: `apps/web/src/types/evaluation.ts` (extend existing BusinessData interface)
- Validation schemas: `apps/web/src/lib/validations/professional-tier.ts`
- API routes: Extend existing `apps/web/src/app/api/evaluations/` endpoints
- Middleware: `apps/web/src/middleware/tier-validation.ts`

### Testing Requirements:
[Source: Current vitest + playwright setup in package.json]
- Unit tests for Professional tier data validation
- Integration tests for tier-based API access
- Migration rollback tests
- Performance tests for JSONB queries vs separate table approach

### Technical Constraints:
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing Basic tier evaluations
- Database changes must be additive only (no breaking changes)
- Performance must not degrade for Basic tier users
- Professional tier data must be encrypted at rest (enterprise security requirement)

### Project Structure Notes:
Following existing pattern in `apps/web/src/types/evaluation.ts` for BusinessData interface extension. All new code follows established Next.js 15 + Prisma + TypeScript patterns.
