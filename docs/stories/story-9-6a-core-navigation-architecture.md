# Story 9.6a: Core Navigation Architecture Redesign - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **platform user**,
I want **a redesigned main navigation with clear information architecture and logical feature grouping**,
So that **I can easily discover and access platform capabilities without confusion**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Current Next.js routing, existing ShadCN/ui components, user authentication
- Technology: Next.js App Router, ShadCN/ui navigation components, TypeScript interfaces
- Follows pattern: Current layout structure enhanced with improved information architecture
- Touch points: Main navigation component, routing system, user role management

## Acceptance Criteria

**Navigation Structure Requirements:**

1. Redesign main navigation with logical feature grouping (Dashboard, Evaluations, Improvements, Market Intelligence, Account)
2. Implement tier-based navigation showing/hiding premium features based on subscription status
3. Add navigation badges for new features and notifications count display
4. Create expandable submenu structure for complex feature areas (Evaluations, Improvements, Account)
5. Implement clean breadcrumb navigation for multi-level page hierarchies

**Technical Integration:**

6. Enhanced navigation integrates seamlessly with existing authentication and role management
7. New navigation follows established ShadCN/ui design patterns and component library
8. Navigation state persists across page navigation and browser refresh
9. All existing URLs and deep links continue to work unchanged

## Technical Implementation

**Navigation Interface Structure:**

```typescript
interface NavigationItem {
  label: string;
  href: string;
  icon: React.ComponentType;
  badge?: string | number;
  submenu?: NavigationItem[];
  requiredTier?: 'free' | 'premium';
  requiresAuth?: boolean;
}
```

**Main Navigation Structure:**

```typescript
const mainNavigation: NavigationItem[] = [
  {
    label: 'Dashboard',
    href: '/dashboard',
    icon: HomeIcon,
    requiresAuth: true
  },
  {
    label: 'Evaluations',
    href: '/evaluations',
    icon: ChartBarIcon,
    submenu: [
      { label: 'New Evaluation', href: '/evaluations/new' },
      { label: 'History', href: '/evaluations/history' },
      { label: 'Comparisons', href: '/evaluations/compare' }
    ],
    requiresAuth: true
  },
  {
    label: 'Improvements',
    href: '/improvements',
    icon: TrendingUpIcon,
    requiredTier: 'premium',
    submenu: [
      { label: 'Opportunities', href: '/improvements/opportunities' },
      { label: 'Implementation Guides', href: '/improvements/guides' },
      { label: 'Progress Tracking', href: '/improvements/progress' }
    ]
  },
  {
    label: 'Market Intelligence',
    href: '/market-intelligence',
    icon: GlobeIcon,
    requiredTier: 'premium',
    badge: 'NEW'
  },
  {
    label: 'Account',
    href: '/account',
    icon: UserIcon,
    submenu: [
      { label: 'Profile', href: '/account/profile' },
      { label: 'Subscription', href: '/account/subscription' },
      { label: 'Settings', href: '/account/settings' }
    ]
  }
];
```

**Implementation Components:**

- **MainNavigation Component**: Tier-aware navigation with submenu support
- **NavigationItem Component**: Individual navigation items with badge support
- **Breadcrumb Component**: Multi-level navigation context
- **NavigationProvider**: Context for navigation state management

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Core navigation architecture implemented with logical feature grouping
- [ ] Tier-based navigation working with premium feature restrictions
- [ ] Submenu structure functional for complex feature areas
- [ ] Breadcrumb navigation implemented for multi-level pages
- [ ] All existing URLs and routing continue to work unchanged
- [ ] Tests pass for navigation functionality and tier restrictions
- [ ] Code follows existing ShadCN/ui patterns and TypeScript standards

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Navigation changes confuse existing users familiar with current structure
- **Mitigation:** A/B testing with gradual rollout, fallback to previous navigation available
- **Rollback:** Feature flag to revert navigation structure, preserve all URLs

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [x] No breaking changes to existing page URLs or deep links
- [x] Navigation changes enhance existing design system
- [x] User authentication and role management integration maintained
- [x] Performance impact minimal with efficient component design

## Implementation Details

**Navigation State Management:**

```typescript
interface NavigationState {
  currentPath: string;
  userTier: 'free' | 'premium';
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  notificationCount: number;
}
```

**Breadcrumb Generation:**

```typescript
const generateBreadcrumbs = (pathname: string, navigation: NavigationItem[]): BreadcrumbItem[] => {
  // Auto-generate breadcrumbs from navigation structure and current path
  // Support for nested submenu breadcrumb trails
};
```

**Premium Feature Handling:**

- Premium features shown with upgrade prompts for free tier users
- Clear visual distinction between available and restricted features
- Smooth upgrade flow integration with existing subscription system

## Estimated Effort: 6-8 hours focused development
