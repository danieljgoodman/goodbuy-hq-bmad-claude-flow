# Story 8.4: Enhanced Dashboard Analytics

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** business owner analyzing my company performance,  
**I want** advanced filtering, comparison, and export capabilities for my dashboard data,  
**so that** I can conduct detailed analysis and share insights with stakeholders.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 8.3 (Dashboard Visualization Foundation) provides the base chart components and dashboard layout that this story will enhance. The existing Recharts integration and dashboard state management should be extended rather than replaced. [Source: Previous story completion record]

### Data Models
**Dashboard Filter State** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management]
```typescript
interface DashboardFilters {
  dateRange: {
    start: Date;
    end: Date;
  };
  businessCategories: string[];
  evaluationTypes: ('completed' | 'processing' | 'failed')[];
  customTimeframe?: {
    label: string;
    days: number;
  };
}

interface ComparisonState {
  selectedEvaluations: string[];
  comparisonMode: 'side-by-side' | 'trend' | 'overlay';
  metrics: string[];
}
```

**Export Data Structures** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#business-evaluation]
```typescript
interface ExportData {
  evaluations: BusinessEvaluation[];
  filters: DashboardFilters;
  generatedAt: Date;
  format: 'pdf' | 'csv';
  includeCharts: boolean;
}

interface ExportHistory {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  filename: string;
  format: 'pdf' | 'csv';
  downloadUrl: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  expiresAt: Date;
}
```

### API Specifications
**Dashboard Analytics Endpoints** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md, extending dashboard APIs]
- `GET /api/v2/dashboard/analytics?filters=...` - Filtered analytics data with comparison capabilities
- `GET /api/v2/dashboard/export?format=pdf|csv&filters=...` - Export generation endpoint
- `GET /api/v2/evaluations/compare?ids=...` - Comparative evaluation data
- `POST /api/v2/dashboard/export-history` - Track export requests for user history

### Component Specifications
**Enhanced Dashboard Components** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#dashboard-components]
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/dashboard/`
- New components: `dashboard-filters.tsx`, `comparison-view.tsx`, `export-modal.tsx`, `quick-actions.tsx`
- Enhanced components: Extend existing chart components with interaction capabilities
- Props: `filters`, `onFilterChange`, `exportOptions`, `comparisonData`

**Chart Interaction Components** [Source: architecture/components.md#chart-components]
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/charts/`
- Enhanced components: Add `interactive-chart-wrapper.tsx` for zoom and drill-down
- Use Recharts advanced features: `ZoomArea`, `Brush`, custom click handlers
- Integration with existing `valuation-chart.tsx`, `health-trend-chart.tsx`

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- Dashboard Components: `apps/web/src/components/dashboard/`
- Chart Components: `apps/web/src/components/charts/` 
- API Routes: `apps/web/src/app/api/v2/dashboard/`
- Export Services: `apps/web/src/lib/services/export-service.ts`
- Types: `apps/web/src/types/dashboard.ts`, `apps/web/src/types/export.ts`

### State Management
**Zustand Store Extensions** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management]
- Extend existing dashboard store with filter state
- Add comparison state management for multiple evaluation analysis
- Implement export history tracking in user preferences store
- Cache filtered results to optimize performance

### Technical Constraints
- Export file generation must complete within 30 seconds for large datasets [Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]
- Chart interactions must maintain 60fps performance during zoom/pan operations
- PDF exports limited to 50MB file size for download performance
- CSV exports must handle up to 10,000 evaluation records efficiently
- Filter state must persist across browser sessions using localStorage

### Integration Points
**Existing Systems** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#business-evaluation]
- Business evaluation data structures (extend existing queries)
- Dashboard visualization components from Story 8.3
- User authentication and subscription tier checking for export limits
- Existing chart theming and responsive design patterns

**External Services** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- PDF generation using Puppeteer or similar for server-side rendering
- File storage via Supabase Storage for temporary export downloads
- Browser download API for client-side file delivery

### Testing

#### Testing Standards

- Service tests: `apps/web/tests/lib/services/` for export service functionality
- API tests: `apps/web/tests/api/v2/dashboard/` for analytics and export endpoints
- E2E tests: `apps/web/tests/e2e/dashboard-analytics.spec.ts`

**Testing Frameworks** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#framework]
- Vitest + React Testing Library for component testing of filters and export modals
- Playwright for E2E testing of complete export workflows and chart interactions
- Supertest for API endpoint testing of export generation

**Specific Testing Requirements**
- Filter performance testing with large datasets (1000+ evaluations)
- Export generation testing for both PDF and CSV formats with various data sizes
- Chart interaction testing for zoom, pan, and drill-down functionality
- Cross-browser compatibility testing for export downloads
- Accessibility testing for enhanced chart interactions and keyboard navigation
- Memory leak testing for filter state changes and chart re-renders
