## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 8.3 (Dashboard Visualization Foundation) provides the base chart components and dashboard layout that this story will enhance. The existing Recharts integration and dashboard state management should be extended rather than replaced. [Source: Previous story completion record]

### Data Models
**Dashboard Filter State** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management]
```typescript
interface DashboardFilters {
  dateRange: {
    start: Date;
    end: Date;
  };
  businessCategories: string[];
  evaluationTypes: ('completed' | 'processing' | 'failed')[];
  customTimeframe?: {
    label: string;
    days: number;
  };
}

interface ComparisonState {
  selectedEvaluations: string[];
  comparisonMode: 'side-by-side' | 'trend' | 'overlay';
  metrics: string[];
}
```

**Export Data Structures** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#business-evaluation]
```typescript
interface ExportData {
  evaluations: BusinessEvaluation[];
  filters: DashboardFilters;
  generatedAt: Date;
  format: 'pdf' | 'csv';
  includeCharts: boolean;
}

interface ExportHistory {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  filename: string;
  format: 'pdf' | 'csv';
  downloadUrl: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  expiresAt: Date;
}
```

### API Specifications
**Dashboard Analytics Endpoints** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md, extending dashboard APIs]
- `GET /api/v2/dashboard/analytics?filters=...` - Filtered analytics data with comparison capabilities
- `GET /api/v2/dashboard/export?format=pdf|csv&filters=...` - Export generation endpoint
- `GET /api/v2/evaluations/compare?ids=...` - Comparative evaluation data
- `POST /api/v2/dashboard/export-history` - Track export requests for user history

### Component Specifications
**Enhanced Dashboard Components** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#dashboard-components]
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/dashboard/`
- New components: `dashboard-filters.tsx`, `comparison-view.tsx`, `export-modal.tsx`, `quick-actions.tsx`
- Enhanced components: Extend existing chart components with interaction capabilities
- Props: `filters`, `onFilterChange`, `exportOptions`, `comparisonData`

**Chart Interaction Components** [Source: architecture/components.md#chart-components]
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/charts/`
- Enhanced components: Add `interactive-chart-wrapper.tsx` for zoom and drill-down
- Use Recharts advanced features: `ZoomArea`, `Brush`, custom click handlers
- Integration with existing `valuation-chart.tsx`, `health-trend-chart.tsx`

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:

- Chart interactions must maintain 60fps performance during zoom/pan operations
- PDF exports limited to 50MB file size for download performance
- CSV exports must handle up to 10,000 evaluation records efficiently
- Filter state must persist across browser sessions using localStorage

### Integration Points
**Existing Systems** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#business-evaluation]
- Business evaluation data structures (extend existing queries)
- Dashboard visualization components from Story 8.3
- User authentication and subscription tier checking for export limits
- Existing chart theming and responsive design patterns

**External Services** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
