### Tech Stack Requirements
**Payment Processing Stack**:
- **Payments**: Stripe API v2023-10-16, Stripe Elements, Stripe CLI
- **Security**: Stripe webhook signatures, PCI compliance via Stripe
- **Database**: Subscription and payment tracking tables
- **Frontend**: React Stripe.js for secure forms

### Technical Constraints
**Security Requirements**:
- Never store card details - use Stripe tokenization only
- Validate all webhook signatures from Stripe
- Implement proper access control based on subscription status
- Use environment variables for all Stripe keys

**Business Logic Requirements**:
- 14-day trial period for all new premium subscriptions
- Prorated billing for mid-cycle upgrades/downgrades
- Graceful handling of failed payments with retry logic
- Cancel at period end to avoid immediate access revocation

### Testing Requirements
**Payment Testing Strategy**:
- Use Stripe test mode and test cards for development
- Test all subscription lifecycle states (trial, active, past_due, etc.)
- Test webhook reliability with Stripe CLI
- Test subscription upgrade/downgrade scenarios
- Test payment failure and retry scenarios

## Testing
**Testing Standards for this Story**:
- Test Stripe integration with test cards and webhooks
- Validate subscription state management and access control
- Test trial period logic and automatic conversions
- Verify billing history and receipt generation
- Test upgrade/downgrade flows with prorated billing
