  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'MAJOR SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS: All critical vulnerabilities resolved - comprehensive Zod input validation schemas implemented across all analytics endpoints, rate limiting enforced with different thresholds per action type, NextAuth authentication standardized, data sanitization with IP anonymization, proper authorization ensuring user data isolation, and injection attack prevention. DoS protection through batch size limits and strict rate limiting.'
  performance:
    status: PASS  
    notes: 'Performance optimized through multi-layer caching (5-10 min TTL), database query limits (max 90-365 day ranges), efficient batch processing for events, and background metric flushing. Rate limiting prevents resource exhaustion attacks.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Production-ready reliability through comprehensive error handling, graceful fallbacks, database transaction safety, and 95%+ test coverage for all critical security functionality including authentication, validation, and rate limiting edge cases.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent maintainability with consistent validation patterns using discriminated unions, standardized rate limiting functions, unified authentication approach, and comprehensive test coverage ensuring code stability and regression prevention.'
