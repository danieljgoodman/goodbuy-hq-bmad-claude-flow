**CR2**: Database schema changes must be fully backward compatible using additive-only modifications (new tables, columns) without altering existing data structures.

**CR3**: New UI components must follow existing ShadCN/ui design system patterns and integrate seamlessly with current Tailwind CSS styling approaches.

**CR4**: Integration points with existing Supabase Auth, PostgreSQL database, and Vercel deployment infrastructure must remain intact without requiring migration.

## User Interface Enhancement Goals

### Integration with Existing UI

The new UI elements will seamlessly integrate with the existing ShadCN/ui component library and Tailwind CSS design system. All dashboard visualizations will use consistent color schemes, typography (existing font stack), and spacing patterns established in the current design system. Interactive elements will maintain the existing button styles, form patterns, and navigation structures while extending them with new chart components, data visualization libraries (likely Chart.js or Recharts for React compatibility), and enhanced layout components.

The admin portal will follow the same component hierarchy as existing authenticated pages, utilizing the current authentication wrapper patterns and layout structures. User settings will extend the existing profile/account management patterns with consistent form layouts, validation styling, and success/error messaging approaches already established in the codebase.

### Modified/New Screens and Views

**Dashboard Transformation**:
- Main dashboard page (currently basic grid) → Interactive dashboard with charts and KPIs
- Individual business evaluation detail views → Enhanced with trend visualizations
- New dashboard filtering and date range selection interfaces

**New Admin Portal**:
- Admin login/access verification page
- User management interface with search, bulk operations, and detail views
- Subscription and billing management dashboard
- System analytics and reporting views
- Audit log and compliance tracking interface

**Enhanced User Settings**:
- Expanded account settings with password management and 2FA setup
- New subscription management interface (upgrade/downgrade/cancel)
- Billing history and invoice download section
- Data export and privacy controls page
- Account deletion/deactivation workflow

**Document Upload Integration**:
- New onboarding choice screen (manual vs. document upload)
- Document upload interface with progress indicators
- AI extraction review/validation screen for parsed data
- Fallback manual input forms for incomplete extractions

### UI Consistency Requirements

**Visual Consistency**: All new interfaces must maintain the existing color palette, use identical typography scales, and follow the established spacing system (Tailwind spacing utilities). Icons must use the same icon library (likely Lucide React) and sizing conventions.

**Interaction Consistency**: Form validation, loading states, error handling, and success messaging must follow existing patterns. Navigation behavior, modal implementations, and page transitions must maintain current user experience expectations.

**Component Reuse**: New features must prioritize extending existing ShadCN/ui components (Button, Input, Card, Dialog, etc.) rather than creating custom alternatives. Any new components must follow the same API patterns and styling approaches as existing components.

**Accessibility Compliance**: All new interfaces must maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance consistent with existing pages, including proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management, and screen reader compatibility.

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: TypeScript 5.3+  
**Frameworks**: Next.js 14+ (App Router), React  
**Database**: PostgreSQL 15+, Redis 7+ (caching)  
**Infrastructure**: Vercel deployment, Supabase Auth, Supabase Storage  
**External Dependencies**: ShadCN/ui components, Tailwind CSS 3.4+, Zustand 4.4+ (state management)  

**Version Constraints**: Next.js 14+ required for App Router architecture, TypeScript 5.3+ for advanced type safety, PostgreSQL 15+ for advanced JSON operations needed for AI data extraction storage.

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: Implement additive schema changes using new tables for admin features (admin_users, admin_audit_logs), document processing (uploaded_documents, extraction_results), and enhanced user preferences (user_dashboard_settings, user_export_history). All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing business evaluation tables.

**API Integration Strategy**: Create versioned API routes (/api/v2/) for new functionality while preserving existing /api/ endpoints. Document processing APIs will use Next.js API routes with longer timeout configurations for AI processing. Admin APIs will implement role-based middleware building on existing Supabase Auth patterns.

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Extend existing Zustand stores for dashboard state, admin portal state, and document upload flows. New UI components will build on ShadCN/ui base components with custom chart components (likely Recharts for React compatibility). Dashboard enhancements will replace existing grid layouts while maintaining the same route structure.

**Testing Integration Strategy**: Extend existing Vitest + React Testing Library setup for component testing, add Playwright scenarios for new user workflows (document upload, admin operations, dashboard interactions), and implement API testing for new v2 endpoints using existing Vitest backend testing patterns.

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: Follow existing Next.js App Router structure with new routes under /app/(admin)/ for admin portal, enhanced /app/(dashboard)/ for improved dashboard, and /app/api/v2/ for new API endpoints. Document processing services will be added to /src/lib/services/ following existing patterns.

**Naming Conventions**: Maintain existing TypeScript naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions, kebab-case for file names). New database tables use snake_case following existing PostgreSQL conventions.

**Coding Standards**: Follow existing ESLint/Prettier configuration, maintain existing TypeScript strict mode settings, and use existing error handling patterns with enhanced logging for new AI processing workflows.

**Documentation Standards**: Extend existing README patterns with new API documentation, add inline JSDoc comments for new service functions, and maintain existing component documentation approaches for new UI components.

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: Utilize existing Next.js build system with enhanced environment variable management for AI service API keys. Document processing will require extended build timeouts and potentially larger memory allocation for AI operations.

**Deployment Strategy**: Maintain existing Vercel deployment pipeline with enhanced environment configuration for admin features and AI service integrations. Implement feature flags for gradual rollout of dashboard enhancements and admin portal access.

**Monitoring and Logging**: Extend existing Vercel Analytics + Sentry setup with enhanced logging for document processing operations, admin portal usage tracking, and dashboard performance monitoring. Add custom metrics for AI processing success rates and user adoption of new features.

**Configuration Management**: Enhance existing environment variable system with new configurations for AI service endpoints, admin role definitions, file upload limits, and dashboard refresh intervals. Maintain separation between development, staging, and production configurations.

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: 
- AI document processing service downtime could block user onboarding
