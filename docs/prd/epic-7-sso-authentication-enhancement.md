**CR2**: Database schema changes are backward compatible - OAuth integration uses existing users table with optional OAuth provider fields

**CR3**: UI changes follow existing ShadCN patterns and TweakCN color system - OAuth UI elements integrate seamlessly with current design system

**CR4**: Integration compatibility maintained - existing protected routes, session management, and user profile workflows remain unchanged

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript
**Frameworks**: Next.js 14+, React 18, ShadCN/ui, Tailwind CSS
**Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase with Prisma ORM
**Infrastructure**: Vercel deployment, Supabase backend services
**External Dependencies**: Supabase Auth, Claude AI API, @supabase/supabase-js v2.38.0

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: Extend existing users table with optional OAuth provider fields (provider, provider_id, provider_data) while maintaining current schema compatibility. OAuth users follow same profile creation workflow through existing AuthService methods.

**API Integration Strategy**: Utilize Supabase's native OAuth providers without additional API endpoints. Existing `/api/auth` routes remain unchanged. OAuth callback handling through Supabase client-side SDK integration with current session management.

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Extend existing auth components (LoginForm, RegisterForm) with OAuth buttons using established ShadCN button patterns. Maintain current protected route system and auth state management through existing AuthService and auth store patterns.

**Testing Integration Strategy**: Integrate OAuth testing into existing Playwright e2e tests and Vitest unit tests. Mock OAuth providers for testing environments while maintaining existing auth flow test coverage.

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: Add OAuth components in `src/components/auth/` alongside existing auth components. OAuth service methods extend existing `AuthService` class. Provider-specific configurations in `src/lib/config.ts`.

**Naming Conventions**: Follow existing patterns - `signInWithGoogle`, `signInWithMicrosoft`, `signInWithApple` methods. OAuth components named `oauth-providers.tsx`, `oauth-callback.tsx` following kebab-case convention.

**Coding Standards**: Maintain existing TypeScript strict mode, ESLint rules, and Prettier formatting. Follow established error handling patterns and type definitions in `src/types/auth.ts`.

**Documentation Standards**: Update existing auth documentation with OAuth flow diagrams and provider setup instructions. Maintain inline code comments for OAuth-specific logic.

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: No changes to existing build pipeline. OAuth configurations managed through environment variables in Vercel deployment settings and Supabase dashboard.

**Deployment Strategy**: Feature flag implementation allows gradual rollout. OAuth providers can be enabled individually through Supabase dashboard configuration without code deployment.

**Monitoring and Logging**: Extend existing auth event logging to include OAuth provider events. Leverage Supabase Auth logs for OAuth-specific monitoring and error tracking.

**Configuration Management**: OAuth client IDs and secrets managed through Supabase dashboard and Vercel environment variables. No sensitive OAuth data in codebase.

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: OAuth provider API changes could break authentication flow. Mitigation: Use Supabase's managed OAuth integration which handles provider API versioning.

**Integration Risks**: OAuth user data might not map cleanly to existing user schema. Mitigation: Implement robust data mapping with fallback values and validation.

**Deployment Risks**: OAuth callback URLs must be configured correctly across environments. Mitigation: Environment-specific callback URL configuration and thorough testing in staging.

**Mitigation Strategies**: Feature flags allow immediate rollback to email/password only. Comprehensive error handling ensures OAuth failures don't break existing auth flows. Provider-specific error states guide users to alternative authentication methods.

## Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: Single comprehensive epic with rationale: This SSO enhancement represents a cohesive authentication improvement that extends existing functionality through Supabase's native OAuth support. While involving multiple OAuth providers, the implementation patterns are nearly identical across providers, making it more efficient to coordinate as a single epic rather than fragmenting across multiple epics. The minimal impact on existing architecture and shared UI/UX patterns further support single epic organization.

## Epic 7: SSO Authentication Enhancement

**Epic Goal**: Implement comprehensive Single Sign-On authentication support through Google, Microsoft, and Apple OAuth providers to reduce signup friction and improve user conversion while maintaining all existing authentication functionality and security standards.

**Integration Requirements**: OAuth integration must extend existing Supabase authentication infrastructure without breaking current email/password workflows, maintain existing user profile management and business onboarding flows, and follow established ShadCN/UI design patterns for consistent user experience.

**IV2**: OAuth provider selection preserves existing user onboarding flow requirements for business information collection

**IV3**: Mobile responsiveness verified across all OAuth providers with special attention to Apple Sign-In mobile optimization

### Story 7.3: OAuth Account Management and Linking

As a registered user,
I want to link my OAuth accounts to my existing email/password account and manage my connected authentication methods,
so that I can use my preferred login method while maintaining my existing business data and subscription.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Account Linking Interface**: User account settings page includes section for managing connected OAuth providers with ability to link/unlink Google, Microsoft, and Apple accounts

2. **OAuth Account Linking Logic**: Users with existing email/password accounts can link OAuth accounts by signing in with OAuth provider using same email address, with proper conflict resolution

3. **Multiple Authentication Methods**: Users can authenticate using any linked method (email/password or any connected OAuth provider) with seamless access to same user profile and business data

4. **OAuth Profile Data Sync**: When users link OAuth accounts, profile information (name, profile picture) can be optionally synced from OAuth provider to existing user profile

5. **Account Security Management**: Account settings display all connected authentication methods with last used timestamps and ability to revoke OAuth connections for security management

#### Integration Verification

**IV1**: Account linking process maintains data integrity with no risk of user profile duplication or data loss

**IV2**: Users can switch between authentication methods without losing session state or access to existing evaluations and business data

**IV3**: OAuth account unlinking gracefully handles edge cases and maintains at least one valid authentication method per user account
