## Background Context

Small and medium business owners are flying blind about their most valuable asset - their business itself. Traditional professional business appraisals cost $10,000-25,000, making them inaccessible for most SMBs, while providing only static point-in-time numbers with no actionable improvement guidance. This creates a massive market gap in the $2.3T annual SMB acquisition market, where 80% of owners don't know their business worth or how to increase its value.

GoodBuy HQ solves this through a revolutionary AI-powered platform that combines multi-layered analysis (health scoring, document intelligence, market intelligence) with implementation-focused guidance. Unlike static calculators or expensive consultations, our platform delivers real-time progress tracking, industry benchmarking, and dynamic growth optimization, transforming business valuation from an expensive one-time expense into an ongoing strategic tool for value creation. Our primary focus targets growth-focused digital entrepreneurs (SaaS, e-commerce, agencies) who value data-driven decisions and cost-effective AI solutions.
