**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running Next.js 14+, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Supabase Auth, and ShadCN/ui
- Integration points: User management system, evaluation workflow, admin dashboard, business data collection forms, and main navigation
- Existing patterns to follow: ShadCN/ui components, Zustand state management, repository pattern for data access, API route structure
- Critical compatibility requirements: Maintain existing user authentication flow, preserve all existing evaluation data, ensure admin changes are auditable, follow established database schema patterns
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact while adding new capabilities

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering enhanced user management, improved data collection, and optimized user experience."
