# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Professional, data-driven interface that instills confidence and trust while remaining approachable for non-technical business owners. The design should feel like a premium financial tool (think Stripe Dashboard meets QuickBooks simplicity) with clear information hierarchy and minimal cognitive load during the evaluation process. The interface must convey sophistication and credibility to justify AI-generated valuations while being intuitive enough for busy entrepreneurs to navigate efficiently.
