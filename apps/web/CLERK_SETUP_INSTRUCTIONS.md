## Next Steps - Action Required

### 1. Add Webhook Secret from Clerk Dashboard

1. Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.dev)
2. Select your application
3. Navigate to **Webhooks** in the left sidebar
4. Click **+ Add Endpoint**
5. Set the endpoint URL to: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/clerk`
   - For local development: Use ngrok or similar to expose your local server
6. Select these events:
   - `user.created`
   - `user.updated`
   - `user.deleted`
7. Copy the **Signing Secret**
8. Update `.env.local`:
   ```
   CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_[YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_HERE]
   ```

### 2. Test the Login System

1. The development server is running at http://localhost:3000
2. Visit http://localhost:3000/sign-in to test login
3. Visit http://localhost:3000/sign-up to test registration

### 3. Customize Sign-In/Sign-Up Pages (Optional)

The current implementation uses Clerk's default components. You can customize them by:

1. Modifying the `appearance` prop in `/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx`
2. Adding custom fields to the sign-up process
3. Implementing social login providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)

### 4. Configure Social Login (Optional)

In Clerk Dashboard:
1. Go to **User & Authentication** → **Social Connections**
2. Enable desired providers (Google, GitHub, Microsoft, etc.)
3. Follow the setup instructions for each provider

### 5. Update Database Schema (If Needed)

The current webhook handler expects these fields in your User table:
- `clerkId` (unique string)
- `email`
- `name`
- `imageUrl`
- `subscriptionTier`
- `subscriptionStatus`
- `deletedAt` (for soft deletes)

Make sure your Prisma schema includes these fields.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Visit `/sign-up` and create a new account
- [ ] Check if user appears in Clerk Dashboard
- [ ] Verify user is created in your database
- [ ] Visit `/sign-in` and log in with created account
- [ ] Test sign out functionality
- [ ] Verify protected routes redirect to sign-in when not authenticated
- [ ] Test that authenticated users can access `/dashboard`

## Troubleshooting

### If sign-in/sign-up pages don't load:
- Check that Clerk API keys are correct in `.env.local`
- Restart the development server after changing environment variables

### If users aren't syncing to database:
- Check webhook configuration in Clerk Dashboard
- Verify `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set correctly
- Check server logs for webhook errors

### If middleware isn't working:
- Ensure `middleware.ts` is in the correct location (apps/web/)
- Check that the matcher configuration includes your protected routes
